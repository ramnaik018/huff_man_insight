## BASIC IDEA OF THIS PROJECT:
1) Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. 
2) The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, 
lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. 
3) The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code

## USAGE OF HUFFMAN CODE:
 Huffman coding is a method of data compression that is independent of the data type, that is, 
 the data could represent an image, audio or spreadsheet. This compression scheme is used in JPEG and MPEG-2. 
 Huffman coding works by looking at the data stream that makes up the file to be compressed.
